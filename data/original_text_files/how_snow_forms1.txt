The air is cold.
Water is in the air.
The water forms tiny ice crystals.
The ice crystals collide with each other.
The ice crystals stick to each other.
The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together.
The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air.
The ice crystals become snowflakes.
The snow flakes fall to the ground as snow.
