When you breathe in, you are taking in air.
Through your bronchial tubes, air enter your lungs.
After the air has passed through the bronchial tubes, it is divided into the bronchioles of each lung.
Alveoli, which are tiny sacs of air, are situated   in the bronchioles.
The alveoli are surrounded by a big number of small blood vessels.
It is through these blood vessels that oxygen moves into the alveoli.
In the course of its journey through the body, the blood enters through the lungs.
When blood returns to the lungs, it takes carbon dioxide along with it.
It is this carbon dioxide that is released when you breathe out.
