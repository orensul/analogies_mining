Morris was a simple-minded prisoner who loved to play the harmonica at night.
Finally, his cellmate got tired of this and demanded that he shut up.
He should always play during the day, the cellmate insisted.
The next night, Morris escaped from prison and hid in a boxcar.
But then Morris remembered that his cellmate said he should play harmonica every day, so he started playing.
Immediately, Morris was nabbed by the cops.
Poor, simple-minded Morris wished he hadn't paid any attention to his cellmate.
Back in his cell, he devoted himself to covering the walls with obscenites.
