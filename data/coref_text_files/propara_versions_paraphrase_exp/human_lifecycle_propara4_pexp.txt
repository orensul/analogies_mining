A zygote is formed via sexual reproduction.
This zygtoe grows in the womb to become a fetus.
After a typical 9-month period, a human is born.
The human is an infant at this stage.
The infant becomes a toddler, and learns to walk and speak.	The toddler becomes a child.
The child becomes a teenager after undergoing puberty.
The teenager grows into an adult.
The adult hits a peak, and development stops.
Old age and eventually death occur
