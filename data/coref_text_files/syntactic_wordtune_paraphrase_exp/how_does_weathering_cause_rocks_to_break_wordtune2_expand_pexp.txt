Environmental particles interact with rocks in a number of ways.
Each time a particle touches the rock, little bits of rock are removed from the rock.
When a particle brush against, hit, or grow against the rocks, the particles remove small pieces of the rock.
These impacts eventually cause the rocks to be broken apart by these impacts.
Eventually, the rock, becomes small rocks as a result of this wear and tear.
By the same force, the rock pieces are getting worn away into smaller and smaller fragments.
